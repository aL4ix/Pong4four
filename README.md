# Pong4four
by aLaix.

Pong4four is a pong game for 4 players with special moves.

This is a remake in python of a game I created while on college. The original game was made in Turbo C++ (hence the primitive graphics and sound). The original remake was made on python2 and later ported to python3.

### Dependencies
Pygame 2.0, Python 3.

### Controls
Player 1: LEFT and RIGHT.

Player 2: BACKSPACE and DELETE.

Player 3: H and J.

Player 4: Q and A.

Or use joysticks.

Enjoy!
